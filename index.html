        <p>Galgotias University hosted the biggest cultural festival in Northern India, themed "Vintage" this year. The two-day extravaganza, held on April 5th and 6th, saw enthusiastic participation from various colleges across more than 20 events organized by the University's societies and clubs. Day 1 - April 5th The first day was packed with a diverse array of events like debates, poetry competitions (Jazbaat-e-Bayaan), dance battles (Rhythm Rumble), fashion shows
        (Walk Vista), business contests (The Antique Venture), theatrical performances (Monoact,
        Nukkad Natak), gaming tournaments (BGMI Battle), music competitions (Swarotsav, Mode
        Maestro), and fun activities like doodling and food challenges (Munchathon) - all with a vintage twist. The highlight was the electrifying performance by renowned Bollywood playback singer Javed Ali, who enthralled the crowd with his mellifluous voice and popular hits like "Kun Faya Kun" and "Jashn-E-Bahaara". Day 2 - April 6th The second day continued the festivities with more exciting events and stalls serving food and treats in keeping with the vintage theme. However, the main attraction was the eagerly awaited celebrity performance by versatile singer-composer Akhil Sachdeva.

The festival concluded on a high note, with Unifest'24 being hailed as the biggest success of the student council, truly capturing the essence of vintage charm.
